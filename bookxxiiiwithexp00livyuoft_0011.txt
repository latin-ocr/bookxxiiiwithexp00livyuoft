PREFACE.

Tms nomos of Book XXIII. of Livy has been prepared
for the use of a large body of pupils, differing in age
and in mental powers3 and it is hoped that the in-
formation supplied will be found such as to meet the
requirements of all those into whose hands it may be
put.

At the head of each chaptera succinet account of iu
contents is placed.

The Notes are occupied with explanations of the
several allusions which occur in the text3 and also
with information respecting various grammatical con-
structions. To this latter point especially the pupils’
attention has been called3 as, without a thorough ac-
quaintance with “parsing,’' there cannot be any real
knowledge of a language3 and, failing this, the sense
of an author can scarcely be otherwise than misunder-
stood in numerous and important passages.

Reference is made to the “ Public School Latin
P1·imer‚'’ as the Grammar now most in use for beginners.
