Curule Ediles. The Plebeian Ediles were originally created, nc. 493,
to be as it were assistants to the Tribunes of the peophe, and to deter-
mine certain lesser causes cntrusted to them. The Curule Ediles were
created from the patric-iaus, for the first time 13.c. 366, to perform
certain public games. The office of the Ediles was to take care of the
city, of its public buildings, temples, theatres, baths, aqueducts‚ public
made, &c.‚ especially when there were no censors ; also to superintend
private buildings, in order that they might not become ruinous, and a
cause of danger to the public. To the Curule Ediles it more especially
belonged to exhibit public games. And this they did, sometimes at
vast expense, in order to pave the way to future honour. It was also
part of their office to examine all plays brought on the stage3 and while
they rewarded or punished actors according to their deserts, they were
bound by oath to give the palm to the most deserving amongst them.
Quoestores. The appointment of the Quoestors seems to have been
nearly coeval with the foundation of Rome itself. Originally they
were but two, and to them was committed the charge of the public
revenues. In the year nc. 423, two were created for the especial pur-
pose of attending the consuls in the field, in order to pay the soldiers,
take charge of the plunder, &e These were called choestores Peregrina
or Provinciales, 01· Militares. Those who remained in Rome were
termed choestores Urbani. The principal charge of these last was the
oare of the treasury‚ which was kept in the temple of Saturn. They
received and expended the public moneys, and kept an account of their
disbursements. They also exacted fines that had been imposed, took
charge of the military standards, entertained foreign ambassadors, pro-
vided them with lodgings, and delivered to them the presents made to
them by the people. The funerals of those buried at the public
expense were directed by them. And further, commanders returning
from war, before they could obtain a triumph, were compelled to swear
that they had written to the senate a true account of the number'of the
enemy slain by them, and of the citizens that were missing from their
soldiers.———d0mi [ξ 121, Β. b].—mayistratus minores. “The lesscr (or
lower) magistrates.” The Tribunes of the Commons, the Quaestors, and
Ediles rank amongst these. But as they have been just specified as
receiving admission into the Senate, the term (if correct) must be
limited to the proesectz' amzonoe, magistrates who had the charge of pro-
viding corn; the duumviri navales, magistrates who had charge of the
cquipping and repairing the public ships¹ and some others—civicam
coronam. ‘⁴ A civic crown '' ; i.e. a crown for having saved the life of a
citizen in war. It was composed of oak leaves, bore the inscription
oh civem servatum (“on account of the saving of a citizen ’‘), and was
presented by the preserved to his mesenen—hoc. ‘⁴ On this account.'’
-deducendz‘ sui. “Of conducting him home'’; literally, “ of leading
him away,” i.e. from the forum. A conducting a. person home was a

mark of high respect.

CHAPTER XXIV.-—Scribendum. Supply esse. “That it must be
written”; i.e. “that a letter must be written‘’ [ἓ 144].-e republicci.
‘¹ For the good (or welsare) of the commonwealth.”—e.r rebus. “ Accord-
ing to circumstances.”—qui precesserit. The relative is sometimes joined,
ns here, to a verb in the subjunctive meod, to denote a purpose cr design ·
