metor Primm ‚· the one who came last, and so was “ nearest ’' to the
magistrate 011 whom 110 attended, was designated Lictor Proximus.
Their office was to remove 1110 crowd out of the way, to see that proper
respect was paid to the magistrate, and to inflict. punishment on those
who were condemned, by scourging them first and then beheading them.
One other matter may be named, as it gave rise to tho admission of

lebeians to the consulate. When a. Consul, or those entitled to havo

ictor-s, returned home, or went on a visit, &c.‚ 10 another house, a
Lictor knocked at. the door with his fasces· In conformity with this
custom, a Lictor of Salpe-ius (a Roman noble, at the time military
tribune with consular power) knocked at his door in the way above
mentioned. It so happened that his wifo’s younger sister, who had
married a plcbeian, was then in his house. She was stung to the
quit-k at thinking that a similar honour could not be paid to her own
husband ; and, on returning home, she so worked upon her father that,

' in conjunction with L. Sextius (subsequently the first Plebeian consul),

 

he took mensures which resulted in the honour which his younger
daughter so eagerly coveted being opened to those of her husband's rank
in life—rostra. ‘⁴ The Rostra.'' An erection for speakers in the
Forum at Rome, so called from its being adorned with the beaks

censores. The Censors were two magistrates originally appointed for
taking an account of the number of the people, and the value of their
property. Originally, too, they continued in office forfive years. Subse-
quently, however, an election of censors took place at the end of every
five years, but those who were elected held their power for only eighteen
months. At first their power was but small, but eventually became very
great. All orders of the State were subject to them. They estimated
the fortunes of citizens; divided them into classes and centuries;
enquired into their morals; could inflict marks of disgrace, by removing
from a higher to a lower rank, and could expel senators from tho
Senate. They had the charge, also, of the public reads, bfidges,
aqueducts, streets, δια, and took care that private persons did not get
possession of the property of the State. Before entering on office they
took an oath that they would do nothing through favour or from
hatred; and when they retired from it, swore that they had acted iu
accordance with their oath.

Curulem magistratum. “A curule magistracy”; iae. a magis-tracy
the holder of which was entitled to the use of a “curule chair.'’ This
was a chair adopted from tho Etrurians, and used by the consuls,
praetors‚ and curule ediles. It was without a back, with four erooked
feet, fixed to the extremities of cross picces of wood. and covered with
leather. Its shape allowed of its being solded together sor the conveni-
ence of carr-iege, and of being set down when the magistrates chose

wude ebur, ‘⁸ the curule ivory.”—Ie9it. Supply eoa-wilm. ¹⁴ Ediles.''
