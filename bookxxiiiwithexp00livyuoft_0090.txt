how much the nearer he is to the hope of bringing the war to a
close.’' Spem is the acc. dependent on propiics. Belli perficiendi is an
instance of ‘⁶ Gerundive attraction’' [ἓ 143], and depende on spem. And
as oblique narrative is here used, the verb sit takes the subjunctive
mood.—jm=cmdum esse. “Must be aided.'' The Gerundive is here used
in “attributive construction,’' and implies necessity [§143].—esse. See
