“In favour of,” or “to the advantage of.” —judices dare. “Granted

the praetor's naming the J’udgeS, from whom the parties to a suit made
their selection. The Capuan Senate would therefore appear, by the
context, to have taken care that all the J'udges whom they offered for
the selection of the litigante shou' d represent the popular feeling, so
that the decision of a suit would be ever in accordance with party

Cmrrnn V.—Ad consulem Romanum. Upon the expulsion of
Tarq uin, the seventh and last king of Rome, B c. 509, two magistrates
were anhually chosen and entrusted with the chief power in the state.
All others, with the exception of the Tribunes of the Commons, were
subject to them. They convened the Senate, assembled the peop ple,
laid before both of them what they pleased, and executed their decrees.
In the time of war they possessed the supreme command. They levied
souliers, appointed the Military Tribunes iu part (part being created by
the people), the centurions, aud other officers. The legal age for the
attainment, of the consulship was forty-three; but before it could be
held it was requisite to have passed through the inferior offices of
Quaestor, AEdile, and Praetor. If one of the Consuls died during office
another was appointed (suffectus or szzbroyatzcs est) in his place; see
