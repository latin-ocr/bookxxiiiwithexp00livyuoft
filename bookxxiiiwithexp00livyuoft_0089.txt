It was customary for all persons who consulted the ancient eracles to
wear a gal-land or wreath on their heads; and as the laurel was sacred
to Apollo, those who went to his oracle at Delphi wore one made of leaves
of that tree.-e.2·sequutum. Supply ea, acc. plur„ as its object- See note

magistrate appointed in any great emergency of 1110 Roman State, and
invested with absolute power, from which, in the earlier times at. leas st,
there was no appeal. U nlikc the other magistr ites, 110 was not elected by
the people; but, on the order of the senate, ho was appointed by 0110 of
the consuls, aster the auspices were taken. and usually at night. His
office lasted for six months, unless he chose to lay it down. During its
continuanee, all other magistr-acies were in abeyance, except the tri-
buneship of the commons. The consuls, indeed, continued to act, but
only in subordination to 1110 Dictator, and without being permitted to
display any ensigns of authority in his presence. At ch. 14 of this
book it is mentioned that a Dictator was not allowed to ride on horse-
back without having first asked and obtained the permission of the
people.. His being required to do this is generally regarded as origin-
