only the Samnite, but the Sidicine enemy as well.'’ This statement
does not tally with the account given by Livy, Bk. vn. ch. 29, sqq.
There it is narrated that the Samnites made war upon the Sidicini,
who were a less power-ful people. IIereupon the Sidicini obtained the
¹ support- of the Campaniam, and these, having given battle to the
enemy, met with defeat. The Samnites then quitted the Sidicini. and
having fortified themselves on Tifata, a hill near Capua, descended in
order of battle into the plain lying between the two places. In the
engagement that followed the Campanians were again routed and
driven inside their town, with the loss of the flower of their troops.
Compelled by necessity, they sought the assistance of Rome, and, on
its being refused, surrendered their country to the Romans as a subject
State. From these events arose the Samnite War, which continued
with varying fortune for about 100 years.—rccrptos in fidem. This is
explained by what is mentioned in the previous note—ad Saticulam.
It was at Saticula that the Roman Consul, Valerius, gained 2 decisivo
victory over the Samnites, after a long and stubborn engagement.
