Observe this use of the imperF. to denote an action often repeated in
time past. So, also, presently in the case of dueebana‘..—ante explorata
“ After previously reconnoitring’'; literally, “ It having been previously
reconnoitred.’' The present is an instance of the nent. abl. sing. of a
perf. part. standing alone as an abl. absolute.——7z5rim. For muer-im ;
perf. subj. of noxa—nobis. Dat. dependent on ademeris [ἓ 106, (3)].
—quos diyuos dua-isti. “Whom you have deemed worthy.'' Double
acc. after duco [ξ 99]. The relative clause here precedes the demon-
strative clause. This mode of construction is especially used when any
matter is to be brought prominently forward. Observe, also, that eos,
which forms one of the two demonstratives dependent on judicas, is
omitted before the relative—quos tuearis. After diqnus, ‘indi-qnus,
idoneus, and sometimes aptus, the relative (in the case required by the
construction) is employed in connection with the subjunctive mood to
denote that of which a person is “worthy, unworthy‚” δια, or for which
he is qualified. Render, therefore, ‘⁴ Of obtaining your p1·otecti0n.''’

CHAPTER XL111.—0mm·a simul facere. “Were doing all things at
the same time‚'⁷ i.e. everything at once. This is explained by what
follows.——indqfensos. Supply essa—indicandum . . . fuisse. The
Gerundive of transitive verbs in connection with snm denotes what
must be done, or what is proper or necessary to be done. Here indic-
andum fuisse is used as an impers. pass. inf.; and the literal soree is,
“that it ought to have been pointed out”; freely, “they ought to
have given information‚” i.e. about those disasters, which had been tho
first matter just brought under Hannibal's notice. The inf. is used
because this reply of Hannibal is in oblique or indirect narrative.—
petcndum. Supply fuisse. The inf. hereis not impersonal,butproesidium
forms its subject. Render, “They ought to have asked for a garrison’';
literally, “ that a gai-rison ought to have been asked for.'’—7zi impetra-
retur. Supply id, i.e. proesidium. ‘⁴' If it were not obtained? ’

Tum denique, {5⁶0- ‘⁴ Then, last of all, they should have complaincd
that assistance had been implorcd without effcct.⁷' With querendum
supplyfuisse. The construction here reverts to the impers. form, as in
indicandum, above. Observe, too, that the Gerundive querendum is
followed by objective clause, frustra opem imploratam, because tho
verb queror is sometimes followed by one [ξ 144, 1, b].—2'mploratam.
Supply essa—omri. Dat. dependent on esset [ᾖ 107].-2·is‚ sc. locis.
—wobz‘liom “More famous‚” or “more renowued.’'—cez‘ero exercitu.
“With the rest of the army.”—Nolam. Ace. of place “whither”

note on ante* explorato ‚· ch. 42.——proecl‹1[um. Supinc in um aster ierat
[ἓ 141, 5].—ipsorum quizm Hannibalis interesse. “It concerned them-
solves, rather than Hannibal.” Ipsorum is Gen. dependent on interesse
[ξ 129]. Before quizm, mayis is omitted—potiretur. “Whether he
should get possession of.'’ Utrum is to be supplied in the first part of
thc clauses—quid interesset. “What difforence thero waS.” Intcrcssct
is an iinpers. vcrb, and lias forits subject the nent. pron. quid—nolle
ominari. ‘⁴ He would not forol›odc.‘' Nolle is inf. in oblique narrative.
