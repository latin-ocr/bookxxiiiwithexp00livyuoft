Filcaquce Romam m. ptam M. Livio dedisset. The construction of
this passage requires notice. Mchtz m is the supine in um from mdo.
strictly speaking, the supine in um follows only a verb or participle
denoting‘ ‘motion” [ξ 141, 5], and expresses the object aimed at by the
verb. The idea of motion is involved in clo, trado, coll5c0, when used of
a woman’s marriage, because her father gives her to a husband “to go
to his house” ; and hence the use of the supine nuptum after them. But.
besides this, Romam is the acc. of the place “whither'’ [ἓ 101], and, as
such, ean occur only after a verb of‘ ‘motion. '¹ There 15, therefore, in
the present passage the idea of going, or being sent, “'to’ a placo for a
particular object, that of marriage The literal rendering—v‘iz. ‘and
had given his daughter, to Rom to veil herself for (ἰ. e. marry) M.
Livius” -is not, only obscure, but faulty as far as English 15 0011-
cerned. Hence the rendering must express what is only implied in tho
Latin—“ and had sent (or taken) her to Rome, and given 1101· 111 mar-
