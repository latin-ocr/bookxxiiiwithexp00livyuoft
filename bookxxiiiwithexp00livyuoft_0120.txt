Rhone by the Carthaginien forces. In
this, however, he was mistaken3 and,
despairing of over-taking the enemy, 118
sent the main body of the army into
Spain, nuder the command of his brothex
Cneius‚ as his lieutenant, and took a
small body of troops back with him into
Italy, with the view of adding them io
the 25,000 troops t'nat were in cisalpine
Gaul, under the command of two prae-
tors. On landing at Pisae (now Pisa)
he aaeumed the chief command, and ad-
vaneed to meet Hannibal. An engage-
ment soon followed, in which Scipio was
defeated and severely wounded. Here-
upon he retreated, and took up his quar·
ters at Placentia (now Piacenza), and
awaited the arrival of his colleague Sem-
pronius, whom he bad summoned to his
assistance from Sicily. Sempronius, on
his arrival, found that Scipio had quitted
Placentia, and encamped upon the banks
of the Trebia (now the Trebbia). As Sci-
pio's wound still prevented active ser-viee

army now devolvcd on Sempronius ; and

result was the disastrous defeat of the
Romans, who were obliged to retire
within the walls of Placentia. In the
following year, Scipio's command being

Upon arriving with the main body of tho
Roman army at Emporiae or Emporium
(now Ampurias), 13.c. 218, his kind and
affable manners, which contrasted most
strongly with the harshneffi of the Car-

¹ thaginians, caused most oi the chiefs on

the sea-coast to join him. In the same
year he defeated the Carthaginians near
Scessis or Cissa (now, probably, Guisonn),

er. This victory made him master ot
Northern Spain. In the following year,
B.c. 217, 118 defeated the Carthagininn
fleet at the mouth oi the Iberus (now the
Ebro), and this secured the command of
the sea. In the course oi the summer 118
