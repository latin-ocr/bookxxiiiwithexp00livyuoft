ab Romanis, ῥ’·σ. “The land in former times unjustly taken away by
the Romans.” In Bk. vm. ch. 3, sqq.‚ Livy states that, in the year
Rc. 340, the Campanians joined. the Latius and made war against
Rome. Being overcome‚ they were deprived of the Falernian terri-
tory, which, together with land taken from the Latins and the citizens of
Privernum, was apportioned out among the Roman commons—imperio.

Qui is sometimes used in combination with the subjunctive, as here, to
denote a “purpose or intention.”—Latinorum postulatio. The Latin
praetor, L. Annius Setinus, had made a demand in the Roman senate, on
behalf of his nation, that one consul should always be a Latin. This
was immediately before the outbreak of the war mentioned above in the
note (tyrum ab Romanis.

when the Romans deelared war against them, 13.c. 281, sent an embassy
to PyrrhuS‚ king of Epirus, begging his aid. Pyrrhus complied with
their request, and crossed over into Italy in the following year. The
Tarentinos, anxious as they‘had been for assistance, were unwilling,
however, to enter the ranks of his army. Further than this, they eom-
pluined in their assemblies of his demands and of the conduct of his
troops. Pyrrhus then treated them as their master, rather than as their
ally, closed their theatre and their public places, and compelled their
youth to serve amongst his soldiers. Hence the ternis here used by Livy.
