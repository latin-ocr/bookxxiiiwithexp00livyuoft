Omma XLVII.—Hoec ubi, ςςτ. “When these things were conveyed
into the camp, and (then) reported to Asellus '’; literally, “were reported
into the camp.”——id moda moratus. “Having delayed merely for the
following reason.'’ Id is an adverbial neut. acm—liceretnepuqnare.
“ Whether he might fight.” Licerct is an impers. verb, and is in the
subj. mood, because the present is an Oblique Interrogation [ξ 149].
It was necessary for Asellus to ask pcrmission to engage Taurea. Had
he acted otherwise, he would have violated discipline, and so have been
liable to forfeit his life, even if he escaped from his adversary. Livy men-
tions, at Bk.vn. ch. 14,that T. Manlius asked for and obtained permission
from the Dictator, his father, to fight with a Gaul who had challenged
the bravest man in the Roman army; and it was from the victory he
then gained that hc obtained the name of Torquatus, from the torques,
or “ collar,” of which he spoiled the Gaul. This same Manlius Torqu-
atus, in his third consulship, ordered his own son, T. Manlius, to be
beheaded for having fought with Geminus Metius, a commandcr of
some Tusculan cavalry, contrary to orders, Liv. Bk. vm. ch. 7.—equo.
Abl, dependent on preivectus.—minime, sis. “ By no means, if you
please” ; meaning, “ Ι am not going to follow you, thank y0u.”—sis=si
vis—cantherium infossam. These words have caused no small amount
of perplexity and discussion. The usual meaning of cantherius is “a
gelding” used for ordinary riding, “a nag’'; while a horse employed.
in war is termed equus. An old Roman writer says that cantherius
signifies, also, an “ass’'; and some have supposed that, in using
it, Taurea played upon the name of his antagonist—asellus meaning “ a
little ass.” By some cantherius has been imagined to be here used
in its derived force of “a support for vines'' made by a pole and
cross-pieces of wood. The simplest explanation seems to consist in
supplying dejecisti from the preceding dejecit,- and thus the passage
will mean, “you have jumped your nag into a ditch.” Asellus had
just leaped down into a hollow road running between high banks,
from which he could not readily get out, thus affording an opportunity
to his adversary, who had outwitted him, to make his escape—qim vooe.
‘¹ And this saying.”—in proverbium. ‘¹ Into a proverb.’' This proverb
came to be applied to a person who had got into a· difficulty—parite.

Cmr'rnn XLV111.—Statiz·a. “A standing (or stationary) camp.”
A camp was thus called in which the Romans remained for any con-
siderable time at the samo spot.—hibcrna. “ A winter-camp.” Winter-
eamps, as tho name implies, were used sor the quartering of troops in
winter. They were strongly fortified, and furnished with workshops,
stores, an infirmary, and such other accommodation as would be obtain-
able, in part at least, in a city. The first on record is one constructed
at the siege of Veii, mentioned by Livy, Bk. v. ch. 2. Rc. 402. The
word there used is hibernacula. “ Summer-camps” were tei-med oestim.
