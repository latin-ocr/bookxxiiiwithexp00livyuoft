emm I.—Castra. At the time of the battle of Cannae the Romans
had two camps. Livy speaks of them at ch. 5, §⁶2 and at Bk. xxxx.
ch. 50, as bina, “two”; while at Bk. xxxx. ch. 52, he calls them majora,
⁸⁴ the greater,” and minora, “ the lesser,'' and gives an account of their
being surrendered and plundered. In the present passage, therefore, the
word implies ‘¹ camps.”-moverat. “Had moved'’ or “advanced.’' In
the present power of movco, the personal pron.‚ in reflexive force, is more
commonly found after liz—se traditurum. Supply esse. Se is not em-
phatic here. See note on quum id nescire, ch. 13 [ἓ 258].—familioe.
In apposition to Mopsianorum [ξ 90].—samam. ‘¹ Repert.”—volqatum
:vulqatum—urbem excessissent. “Had quitted the city.'’ The verb
is here used in an active force, and is in the subjunctive meod after
quum [ἓ 153, (1)].—Poen0. “To the Carthaginian,” τῖε, Hannibal.—
proedd atque impedimentis relictis. Abl. Abs. [ξ 125]. Relictis belongs
to proedd as well as to impedimentis, and is in the plur. number and
neut. gender, not merely in consequence of impedinaentis being in the
plur.. but also because the two substantives denote ‘⁴ things.'‘—e.rercilu
partito. Abl. Abs. [ξ 125].-—mare inferum. ¹‘ The lower sea’'; i.e. the
Tuscan. The Adriatic was called mare superum, “the upper sea.”—-
oppuqnaturus. The fut. part. is here used to denote a purpose or inten-
tion; “for the purpose of laying siege to.''-—maritimam. ‘⁶ On the
sea-coast.”

Ubi intravit. In historical narrative, ubi, postquam, ut, simul ac,
and other adverbs signifying ‘⁴ when, as soon as,'’ are joined at times to
the perf. ind. when a pluperf. would have been expected. Such a perf„
however, is to be translated as a pluperf. Render, therefore, ‘⁴ When
he had entered.”—Numidas partim. “The Numidians in part,” i.e. part,
or some, of the Numidians. The more usual mode of expression would
be Numidarum, or e Numidis, partim—alios. Supply Numidas ; alios
is a correlative to partim, and is the subject of obequitare [ξ 94, (1)].—
εὶηᾱε. “Recesses.''-actam. Part. perf. pass. of ayo, a verb used of
the mptum, δια, of men or animals: sero is used of portable things.
The two verbs are frequently found in combination, and are then equival-
ent to the Greek expression ἄγειν καὶ ‹pipam—portis. Dative dependent
